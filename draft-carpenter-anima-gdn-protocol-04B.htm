<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The success of the Internet has made IP-based networks bigger and more complicated. Large-scale ISP and enterprise networks have become more and more problematic for human based management. Also, operational costs are growing quickly.  Consequently, there are increased requirements for autonomic behavior in the networks.  General aspects of autonomic networks are discussed in <a href="#I-D.irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions">[I-D.irtf-nmrg-autonomic-network-definitions]</a> and <a href="#I-D.irtf-nmrg-an-gap-analysis">[I-D.irtf-nmrg-an-gap-analysis]</a>.  A reference model for autonomic networking is given in <a href="#I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model">[I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model]</a>.  In order to fulfil autonomy, devices that embody autonomic service agents have specific signaling requirements. In particular they need to discover each other, to synchronize state with each other, and to negotiate parameters and resources directly with each other.  There is no restriction on the type of parameters and resources concerned, which include very basic information needed for addressing and routing, as well as anything else that might be configured in a conventional network.  The atomic unit of synchronization or negotiation is referred to as an objective, defined more precisely later in this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Following this Introduction, <a href="#reqts">Section 2</a> describes the requirements for discovery, synchronization and negotiation.  Negotiation is an iterative process, requiring multiple message exchanges forming a closed loop between the negotiating devices. State synchronization, when needed, can be regarded as a special case of negotiation, without iteration.  <a href="#highlevel">Section 3.2</a> describes a behavior model for a protocol intended to support discovery, synchronization and negotiation. The design of Generic Discovery and Negotiation Protocol (GDNP) in <a href="#Overview">Section 3</a> of this document is mainly based on this behavior model. The relevant capabilities of various existing protocols are reviewed in <a href="#current">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The proposed discovery mechanism is oriented towards synchronization and negotiation objectives. It is based on a neighbor discovery process, but also supports diversion to off-link peers. Although many negotiations will occur between horizontally distributed peers, many target scenarios are hierarchical networks, which is the predominant structure of current large-scale managed networks.  However, when a device starts up with no pre-configuration, it has no knowledge of the topology. The protocol itself is capable of being used in a small and/or flat network structure such as a small office or home network as well as a professionally managed network.  Therefore, the discovery mechanism needs to be able to allow a device to bootstrap itself without making any prior assumptions about network structure. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Because GDNP can be used to perform a decision process among distributed devices or between networks, it must run in a secure and strongly authenticated environment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">It is understood that in realistic deployments, not all devices will support GDNP. It is expected that some autonomic service agents will directly manage a group of non-autonomic nodes, and that other non-autonomic nodes will be managed traditionally. Such mixed scenarios are not discussed in this specification.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#reqts" id="reqts">Requirement Analysis of Discovery, Synchronization and Negotiation</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">This section discusses the requirements for discovery, negotiation and synchronization capabilities. The primary user of the protocol is an autonomic service agent (ASA), so the requirements are mainly expressed as the features needed by an ASA.  A single physical device might contain several ASAs, and a single ASA might manage several objectives. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> Requirements for Discovery</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">1. ASAs may be designed to manage anything, as required in <a href="#synchreq">Section 2.2</a>. A basic requirement is therefore that the protocol can represent and discover any kind of network objective among arbitrary subsets of participating nodes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">In an autonomic network we must assume that when a device starts up it has no information about any peer devices, the network structure, or what specific role it must play. The ASA(s) inside the device are in the same situation. In some cases, when a new application session starts up within a device, the device or ASA may again lack information about relevant peers. It might be necessary to set up resources on multiple other devices, coordinated and matched to each other so that there is no wasted resource. Security settings might also need updating to allow for the new device or user.  The relevant peers may be different for different technical objectives. Therefore discovery needs to be repeated as often as necessary to find peers capable of acting as counterparts for each objective that a discovery initiator needs to handle.  From this background we derive the next three requirements:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">2. When an ASA first starts up, it has no knowledge of the specific network to which it is attached.  Therefore the discovery process must be able to support any network scenario, assuming only that the device concerned is bootstrapped from factory condition.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">3. When an ASA starts up, it must require no information about any peers in order to discover them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.5">4. If an ASA supports multiple objectives, relevant peers may be different for different discovery objectives, so discovery needs to be repeated to find counterparts for each objective. Thus, there must be a mechanism by which an ASA can separately discover peer ASAs for each of the technical objectives that it needs to manage, whenever necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.6">5. Following discovery, an ASA will normally perform negotiation or synchronization for the corresponding objectives. The design should allow for this by associating discovery, negotiation and synchronization objectives. It may provide an optional mechanism to combine discovery and negotiation/synchronization in a single call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.7">6. Some objectives may only be significant on the local link, but others may be significant across the routed network and require off-link operations. Thus, the relevant peers might be immediate neighbors on the same layer 2 link, or they might be more distant and only accessible via layer 3. The mechanism must therefore provide both on-link and off-link discovery of ASAs supporting specific technical objectives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.8">7. The discovery process should be flexible enough to allow for special cases, such as the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>In some networks, as mentioned above, there will be some hierarchical structure, at least for certain synchronization or negotiation objectives, but this is unknown in advance. The discovery protocol must therefore operate regardless of hierarchical structure, which is an attribute of individual objectives and not of the autonomic network as a whole.  This is part of the more general requirement to discover off-link peers.</li>
  <li>During initialisation, a device must be able to establish mutual trust with the rest of the network and join an authentication mechanism. Although this will inevitably start with a discovery action, it is a special case precisely because trust is not yet established. This topic is the subject of <a href="#I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra">[I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]</a>.  We require that once trust has been established for a device, all ASAs within the device inherit the device's credentials and are also trusted.</li>
  <li>Depending on the type of network involved, discovery of other central functions might be needed, such as the Network Operations Center (NOC) <a href="#I-D.eckert-anima-stable-connectivity">[I-D.eckert-anima-stable-connectivity]</a>.  The protocol must be capable of supporting such discovery during initialisation, as well as discovery during ongoing operation.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.9">8. The discovery process must not generate excessive (multicast) traffic and must take account of sleeping nodes in the case of a resource-constrained network. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> <a href="#synchreq" id="synchreq">Requirements for Synchronization and Negotiation Capability</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">As background, consider the example of routing protocols, the closest approximation to autonomic networking already in widespread use. Routing protocols use a largely autonomic model based on distributed devices that communicate repeatedly with each other. The focus is reachability, so current routing protocols mainly consider simple link status, i.e., up or down, and an underlying assumption is that all nodes need a consistent view of the network topology in order for the routing algorithm to converge. Thus, routing is mainly based on information synchronization between peers, rather than on bi-directional negotiation. Other information, such as latency, congestion, capacity, and particularly unused capacity, would be helpful to get better path selection and utilization rate, but is not normally used in distributed routing algorithms. Additionally, autonomic networks need to be able to manage many more dimensions, such as security settings, power saving, load balancing, etc.  Status information and traffic metrics need to be shared between nodes for dynamic adjustment of resources and for monitoring purposes.  While this might be achieved by existing protocols when they are available, the new protocol needs to be able to support parameter exchange, including mutual synchronization, even when no negotiation as such is required. In general, these parameters do not apply to all participating nodes, but only to a subset. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">9. A basic requirement for the protocol is therefore the ability to represent, discover, synchronize and negotiate almost any kind of network parameter among arbitrary subsets of participating nodes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">10. Negotiation is a request/response process that must be guaranteed to terminate (with success or failure) and if necessary it must contain tie-breaking rules for each technical objective that requires them. While these must be defined specifically for each use case, the protocol should have some general mechanisms in support of loop and deadlock prevention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">11. Synchronization might concern small groups of nodes or very large groups.  Different solutions might be needed at different scales. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.5">12. To avoid "reinventing the wheel", the protocol should be able to carry the message formats used by existing configuration protocols in cases where that is convenient.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.6">13. Human intervention in complex situations is costly and error-prone.  Therefore, synchronization or negotiation of parameters without human intervention is desirable whenever the coordination of multiple devices can improve overall network performance. It follows that a requirement for the protocol is to be capable of running in any device that would otherwise need human intervention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.7">14. Human intervention in large networks is often replaced by use of a top-down network management system (NMS). It therefore follows that a requirement for the protocol is to be capable of running in any device that would otherwise be managed by an NMS, and that it can co-exist with an NMS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.8">15. Some features are expected to be implemented by individual ASAs, but the protocol must be general enough to allow them: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Dependencies and conflicts: In order to decide a configuration on a given device, the device may need information from neighbors. This can be established through the negotiation procedure, or through synchronization if that is sufficient. However, a given item in a neighbor may depend on other information from its own neighbors, which may need another negotiation or synchronization procedure to obtain or decide.  Therefore, there are potential dependencies and conflicts among negotiation or synchronization procedures. Resolving dependencies and conflicts is a matter for the individual ASAs involved.  To allow this, there need to be clear boundaries and convergence mechanisms for negotiations. Also some mechanisms are needed to avoid loop dependencies. In such a case, the protocol's role is limited to signaling between ASAs. </li>
  <li>Recovery from faults and identification of faulty devices should be as automatic as possible. The protocol's role is limited to the ability to handle discovery, synchronization and negotiation at any time, in case an ASA detects an anomaly such as a negotiation counterpart failing.</li>
  <li>Since the goal is to minimize human intervention, it is necessary that the network can in effect "think ahead" before changing its parameters. In other words there must be a possibility of forecasting the effect of a change by a "dry run" mechanism before actually installing the change. This will be an application of the protocol rather than a feature of the protocol itself. </li>
  <li>Management logging, monitoring, alerts and tools for intervention are required.  However, these can only be features of individual ASAs.  Another document <a href="#I-D.eckert-anima-stable-connectivity">[I-D.eckert-anima-stable-connectivity]</a> discusses how such agents may be linked into conventional OAM systems via an Autonomic Control Plane <a href="#I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-control-plane">[I-D.behringer-anima-autonomic-control-plane]</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.9">16. The protocol will be able to deal with a wide variety of technical objectives, covering any type of network parameter.  Therefore the protocol will need either an explicit information model describing its messages, or at least a flexible and extensible message format. One design consideration is whether to adopt an existing information model or to design a new one. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> Specific Technical Requirements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">17. It should be convenient for ASA designers to define new objectives and for programmers to express them, without excessive impact on run-time efficiency and footprint. The classes of device in which the protocol might run is discussed in <a href="#I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model">[I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">18. The protocol should be extensible in case the initially defined discovery, synchronization and negotiation mechanisms prove to be insufficient. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.3">19. To be a generic platform, the protocol payload format should be independent of the transport protocol or IP version.  In particular, it should be able to run over IPv6 or IPv4.  However, some functions, such as multicasting or broadcasting on a link, might need to be IP version dependent. In case of doubt, IPv6 should be preferred.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.4">20. The protocol must be able to access off-link counterparts via routable addresses, i.e., must not be restricted to link-local operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.5">21. It must also be possible for an external discovery mechanism to be used, if appropriate for a given objective. In other words, GDNP discovery must not be a prerequisite for GDNP negotiation or synchronization; the prerequisite is discovering a peer's locator by any method. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.6">22. ASAs and the signaling protocol engine need to run asynchronously when wait states occur.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.7">23. Intent: There must be provision for general policy intent rules to be applied by all devices in the network (e.g., security rules, prefix length, resource sharing rules). However, intent distribution might not use the signaling protocol itself. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.8">24. Management monitoring, alerts and intervention: Devices should be able to report to a monitoring system. Some events must be able to generate operator alerts and some provision for emergency intervention must be possible (e.g.  to freeze synchronization or negotiation in a mis-behaving device). These features may not use the signaling protocol itself.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.9">25. The protocol needs to be fully secured against forged messages and man-in-the middle attacks, and secured as much as reasonably possible against denial of service attacks. It needs to be capable of encryption in order to resist unwanted monitoring, although this capability may not be required in all deployments. However, it is not required that the protocol itself provides these security features; it may depend on an existing secure environment. </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">The following additional terms are used throughout this document: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Discovery: a process by which an ASA discovers peers according to a specific discovery objective. The discovery results may be different according to the different discovery objectives.  The discovered peers may later be used as negotiation counterparts or as sources of synchronization data. </li>
  <li>Negotiation: a process by which two (or more) ASAs interact iteratively to agree on parameter settings that best satisfy the objectives of one or more ASAs.</li>
  <li>State Synchronization: a process by which two (or more) ASAs interact to agree on the current state of parameter values stored in each ASA. This is a special case of negotiation in which information is sent but the ASAs do not request their peers to change parameter settings. All other definitions apply to both negotiation and synchronization. </li>
  <li>Objective: An objective in GDNP is a configurable state of some kind, which occurs in three contexts: Discovery, Negotiation and Synchronization. In the protocol, an objective is represented by an identifier (actually a GDNP option number) and if relevant a value.  Normally, a given objective will occur during discovery and negotiation, or during discovery and synchronization, but not in all three contexts.  <ul><li>One ASA may support multiple independent objectives.</li><li>The parameter described by a given objective is naturally based on a specific service or function or action. It may in principle be anything that can be set to a specific logical, numerical or string value, or a more complex data structure, by a network node.  That node is generally expected to contain an ASA which may itself manage other nodes.</li><li>Discovery Objective: if a node needs to synchronize or negotiate a specific objective but does not know a peer that supports this objective, it starts a discovery process. The objective is called a Discovery Objective during this process.</li><li>Synchronization Objective: an objective whose specific technical content needs to be synchronized among two or more ASAs. </li><li>Negotiation Objective: an objective whose specific technical content needs to be decided in coordination with another ASA. </li></ul></li>
  <li>Discovery Initiator: an ASA that spontaneously starts discovery by sending a discovery message referring to a specific discovery objective.</li>
  <li>Discovery Responder: a peer ASA which responds to the discovery objective initiated by the discovery initiator.</li>
  <li>Synchronization Initiator: an ASA that spontaneously starts synchronization by sending a request message referring to a specific synchronization objective.</li>
  <li>Synchronization Responder: a peer ASA which responds with the value of a synchronization objective.</li>
  <li>Negotiation Initiator: an ASA that spontaneously starts negotiation by sending a request message referring to a specific negotiation objective.</li>
  <li>Negotiation Counterpart: a peer with which the Negotiation Initiator negotiates a specific negotiation objective.</li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#highlevel" id="highlevel">High-Level Design Choices</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">This section describes a behavior model and some considerations for designing a generic discovery, synchronization and negotiation protocol, which can act as a platform for different technical objectives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">NOTE: This protocol is described here in a stand-alone fashion as a proof of concept. An early version was prototyped by Huawei and the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. However, this is not yet a definitive proposal for IETF adoption. In particular, adaptation and extension of one of the protocols discussed in <a href="#current">Appendix A</a> might be an option. This whole specification is subject to change as a result.</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>A generic platform<br/><br/> The protocol is designed as a generic platform, which is independent from the synchronization or negotiation contents. It takes care of the general intercommunication between counterparts. The technical contents will vary according to the various synchronization or negotiation objectives and the different pairs of counterparts.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Security infrastructure and trust relationship<br/><br/> Because this negotiation protocol may directly cause changes to device configurations and bring significant impacts to a running network, this protocol is assumed to run within an existing secure environment with strong authentication.  <br/><br/> On the other hand, a limited negotiation model might be deployed based on a limited trust relationship. For example, between two administrative domains, ASAs might also exchange limited information and negotiate some particular configurations based on a limited conventional or contractual trust relationship.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Discovery, synchronization and negotiation designed together<br/><br/> The discovery method and the synchronization and negotiation methods are designed in the same way and can be combined when this is useful. These processes can also be performed independently when appropriate.  <ul><li>GDNP discovery is appropriate for efficient discovery of GDNP peers and allows a rapid mode of operation described in <a href="#discmech">Section 3.3.3</a>.  For some parameters, especially those concerned with application layer services, a text-based discovery mechanism such as DNS Service Discovery <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-requirements">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-requirements]</a> or Service Location Protocol <a href="#RFC2608">[RFC2608]</a> might be more appropriate. The choice is left to the designers of individual ASAs.  </li></ul></li>
  <li>A uniform pattern for technical contents<br/><br/> The synchronization and negotiation contents are defined according to a uniform pattern. They could be carried either in simple TLV (Type, Length and Value) format or in payloads described by a flexible language. The initial protocol design uses the TLV approach.  The format is extensible for unknown future requirements. <br/><br/></li>
  <li>A conservative model for synchronization<br/><br/> GDNP supports bilateral synchronization, which could be used to perform synchronization among a small number of nodes.  <ul><li>For some parameters, synchronization across large groups of nodes, possibly including all autonomic nodes, might be needed.  For such cases, a flooding mechanism such as ADNCP <a href="#I-D.stenberg-anima-adncp">[I-D.stenberg-anima-adncp]</a> is considered more appropriate.  GDNP can coexist with ADNCP. The choice is left to the designers of individual ASAs.  </li></ul></li>
  <li>A simple initiator/responder model for negotiation<br/><br/> Multi-party negotiations are too complicated to be modeled and there might be too many dependencies among the parties to converge efficiently. A simple initiator/responder model is more feasible and can complete multi-party negotiations by indirect steps.  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>Organizing of synchronization or negotiation content<br/><br/> Naturally, the technical content will be organized according to the relevant function or service. The content from different functions or services is kept independent from each other. They are not combined into a single option or single session because these contents may be negotiated or synchronized with different counterparts or may be different in response time.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Self-aware network device<br/><br/>Every autonomic device will be pre-loaded with various functions and ASAs and will be aware of its own capabilities, typically decided by the hardware, firmware or pre-installed software. Its exact role may depend on policy intent and on the surrounding network behaviors, which may include forwarding behaviors, aggregation properties, topology location, bandwidth, tunnel or translation properties, etc. The surrounding topology will depend on the network planning. Following an initial discovery phase, the device properties and those of its neighbors are the foundation of the synchronization or negotiation behavior of a specific device. A device has no pre-configuration for the particular network in which it is installed.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Requests and responses in negotiation procedures<br/><br/> The initiator can negotiate with its relevant negotiation counterpart ASAs, which may be different according to the specific negotiation objective. It can request relevant information from the negotiation counterpart so that it can decide its local configuration to give the most coordinated performance. It can request the negotiation counterpart to make a matching configuration in order to set up a successful communication with it. It can request certain simulation or forecast results by sending some dry run conditions.  <br/><br/>Beyond the traditional yes/no answer, the responder can reply with a suggested alternative if its answer is 'no'. This would start a bi-directional negotiation ending in a compromise between the two ASAs.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Convergence of negotiation procedures<br/><br/> To enable convergence, when a responder makes a suggestion of a changed condition in a negative reply, it should be as close as possible to the original request or previous suggestion. The suggested value of the third or later negotiation steps should be chosen between the suggested values from the last two negotiation steps. In any case there must be a mechanism to guarantee convergence (or failure) in a small number of steps, such as a timeout or maximum number of iterations.  <br/><br/> <ul><li>End of negotiation<br/><br/> A limited number of rounds, for example three, or a timeout, is needed on each ASA for each negotiation objective. It may be an implementation choice, a pre-configurable parameter, or a network-wide policy intent.  These choices might vary between different types of ASA.  Therefore, the definition of each negotiation objective MUST clearly specify this, so that the negotiation can always be terminated properly.  <br/><br/></li><li>Failed negotiation<br/><br/>There must be a well-defined procedure for concluding that a negotiation cannot succeed, and if so deciding what happens next (deadlock resolution, tie-breaking, or revert to best-effort service). Again, this MUST be specified for individual negotiation objectives, as an implementation choice, a pre-configurable parameter, or a network-wide policy intent.</li></ul></li>

<ul>
  <li>Separated discovery and negotiation mechanisms<ul class="empty"><li>Although discovery and negotiation or synchronization are defined together in the GDNP, they are separated mechanisms. The discovery process could run independently from the negotiation or synchronization process. Upon receiving a discovery (<a href="#DiscoveryMessage">Section 3.6.2</a>) or request (<a href="#RequestMessage">Section 3.6.4</a>) message, the recipient ASA should return a message in which it either indicates itself as a discovery responder or diverts the initiator towards another more suitable ASA.</li><li>The discovery action will normally be followed by a negotiation or synchronization action. The discovery results could be utilized by the negotiation protocol to decide which ASA the initiator will negotiate with.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Discovery Procedures<ul class="empty"><li>Discovery starts as an on-link operation. The Divert option can tell the discovery initiator to contact an off-link ASA for that discovery objective. Every DISCOVERY message is sent by a discovery initiator via UDP to the ALL_GDNP_NEIGHBOR multicast address (<a href="#Constants">Section 3.4</a>). Every network device that supports the GDNP always listens to a well-known UDP port to capture the discovery messages.</li><li>If an ASA in the neighbor device supports the requested discovery objective, it MAY respond with a Response message (<a href="#ResponseMessage">Section 3.6.3</a>) with locator option(s). Otherwise, if the neighbor has cached information about an ASA that supports the requested discovery objective (usually because it discovered the same objective before), it SHOULD respond with a Response message with a Divert option pointing to the appropriate Discovery Responder.</li><li>If no discovery response is received within a reasonable timeout (default GDNP_DEF_TIMEOUT milliseconds, <a href="#Constants">Section 3.4</a>), the DISCOVERY message MAY be repeated, with a newly generated Session ID (<a href="#SessionID">Section 3.5</a>). An exponential backoff SHOULD be used for subsequent repetitions, in order to mitigate possible denial of service attacks.</li><li>After a GDNP device successfully discovers a Discovery Responder supporting a specific objective, it MUST cache this information. This cache record MAY be used for future negotiation or synchronization, and SHOULD be passed on when appropriate as a Divert option to another Discovery Initiator. The cache lifetime is an implementation choice.</li><li>If multiple Discovery Responders are found for the same objective, they SHOULD all be cached, unless this creates a resource shortage. The method of choosing between multiple responders is an implementation choice.</li><li>A GDNP device with multiple link-layer interfaces (typically a router) MUST support discovery on all interfaces. If it receives a DISCOVERY message on a given interface for a specific objective that it does not support and for which it has not previously discovered a Discovery Responder, it MUST relay the query by re-issuing the same DISCOVERY message on its other interfaces.  However, it MUST limit the total rate at which it relays discovery messages to a reasonable value, in order to mitigate possible denial of service attacks.  It MUST cache the Session ID value of each relayed discovery message and, to prevent loops, MUST NOT relay a DISCOVERY message which carries such a cached Session ID. </li><li>This relayed discovery mechanism, with caching of the results, should be sufficient to support most network bootstrapping scenarios.</li></ul></li>
  <li>A complete discovery process will start with multicast on the local link; a neighbor might divert it to an off-link destination, which could be a default higher-level gateway in a hierarchical network.  Then discovery would continue with a unicast to that gateway; if that gateway is still not the right counterpart, it should divert to another gateway, which is in principle closer to the right counterpart. Finally the right counterpart responds to start the negotiation or synchronization process.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.1">A negotiation initiator sends a negotiation request to a counterpart ASA, including a specific negotiation objective.  It may request the negotiation counterpart to make a specific configuration. Alternatively, it may request a certain simulation or forecast result by sending a dry run configuration.  The details, including the distinction between dry run and an actual configuration change, will be defined separately for each type of negotiation objective.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.2">If the counterpart can immediately apply the requested configuration, it will give an immediate positive (accept) answer.  This will end the negotiation phase immediately. Otherwise, it will negotiate. It will reply with a proposed alternative configuration that it can apply (typically, a configuration that uses fewer resources than requested by the negotiation initiator). This will start a bi-directional negotiation to reach a compromise between the two ASAs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.3">The negotiation procedure is ended when one of the negotiation peers sends a Negotiation Ending message, which contains an accept or decline option and does not need a response from the negotiation peer. Negotiation may also end in failure (equivalent to a decline) if a timeout is exceeded or a loop count is exceeded. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.4.p.4">A negotiation procedure concerns one objective and one counterpart. Both the initiator and the counterpart may take part in simultaneous negotiations with various other ASAs, or in simultaneous negotiations about different objectives. Thus, GDNP is expected to be used in a multi-threaded mode. Certain negotiation objectives may have restrictions on multi-threading, for example to avoid over-allocating resources.</p>

However, the indication is only advisory not prescriptive. </li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.1">Objective Options MUST be assigned an option type greater than G63 in the GDNP option table.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.2">An Objective Option that contains no additional fields, i.e., has a length of 4 octets, is a discovery objective and MUST only be used in Discovery and Response messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.3">The Negotiation Objective Options contain negotiation objectives, which are various according to different functions/services. They MUST be carried by Discovery, Request or Negotiation Messages only. The negotiation initiator MUST set the initial "loop-count" to a value specified in the specification of the objective or, if no such value is specified, to GDNP_DEF_LOOPCT.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.4">For most scenarios, there should be initial values in the negotiation requests. Consequently, the Negotiation Objective options MUST always be completely presented in a Request message, or in a Discovery message in rapid mode. If there is no initial value, the bits in the value field SHOULD all be set to 1 to indicate a meaningless value, unless this is inappropriate for the specific negotiation objective.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.5">Synchronization Objective Options are similar, but MUST be carried by Discovery, Request or Response messages only. They include value fields only in Response messages. </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.8.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.8.3">3.8.3.</a> Organizing of Objective Options</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.3.p.1">As noted earlier, one negotiation objective is handled by each GDNP negotiation thread. Therefore, a negotiation objective, which is based on a specific function or action, SHOULD be organized as a single GDNP option. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to organize multiple negotiation objectives into a single option, nor to split a single function or action into multiple negotiation objectives. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.3.p.2">A synchronization objective SHOULD also be organized as a single GDNP option.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.3.p.3">Some objectives will support more than one operational mode.  An example is a negotiation objective with both a "dry run" mode (where the negotiation is to find out whether the other end can in fact make the requested change without problems) and a "live" mode. Such modes will be defined in the specification of such an objective. These objectives SHOULD include a "flags" octet, with bits indicating the applicable mode(s).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.3.p.4">An objective may have multiple parameters. Parameters can be categorized into two classes: the obligatory ones presented as fixed fields; and the optional ones presented in TLV sub-options or some other form of data structure. The format might be inherited from an existing management or configuration protocol, the objective option acting as a carrier for that format.  The data structure might be defined in a formal language, but that is a matter for the specifications of individual objectives.  There are many candidates, according to the context, such as ABNF, RBNF, XML Schema, possibly YANG, etc. The GDNP protocol itself is agnostic on these questions. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.3.p.5">It is NOT RECOMMENDED to split parameters in a single objective into multiple options, unless they have different response periods. An exception scenario may also be described by split objectives.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.8.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.8.4">3.8.4.</a> Vendor Specific Objective Options </h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.4.p.1">Option codes G128~159 have been reserved for vendor specific options. Multiple option codes have been assigned because a single vendor might use multiple options simultaneously. These vendor specific options are highly likely to have different meanings when used by different vendors. Therefore, they SHOULD NOT be used without an explicit human decision and SHOULD NOT be used in unmanaged networks such as home networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.4.p.2">There is one general requirement that applies to all vendor specific options. They MUST start with a field that uniquely identifies the enterprise that defines the option, in the form of a registered 32 bit Private Enterprise Number (PEN) <a href="#I-D.liang-iana-pen">[I-D.liang-iana-pen]</a>. There is no default value for this field.  Note that it is not used during discovery. It MUST be verified during negotiation or synchronization.</p>

Multiple option codes have been assigned because a single experiment may use multiple options simultaneously. These experimental options are highly likely to have different meanings when used for different experiments.

<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Open Issues</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">There are various unresolved design questions that are worthy of more work in the near future, as listed below (statically numbered in historical order for reference purposes, with the resolved issues retained for reference): </p>

<ul>
  <li>1. UDP vs TCP: For now, this specification suggests UDP and TCP as message transport mechanisms. This is not clarified yet. UDP is good for short conversations, is necessary for multicast discovery, and generally fits the discovery and divert scenarios well. However, it will cause problems with large messages. TCP is good for stable and long sessions, with a little bit of time consumption during the session establishment stage. If messages exceed a reasonable MTU, a TCP mode will be required in any case.  This question may be affected by the security discussion.  <br/><br/> RESOLVED by specifying UDP for short message and TCP for longer one.  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>2. DTLS or TLS vs built-in security mechanism. For now, this specification has chosen a PKI based built-in security mechanism based on asymmetric cryptography. However, (D)TLS might be chosen as security solution to avoid duplication of effort. It also allows essentially similar security for short messages over UDP and longer ones over TCP. The implementation trade-offs are different.  The current approach requires expensive asymmetric cryptographic calculations for every message. (D)TLS has startup overheads but cheaper crypto per message.  DTLS is less mature than TLS.  <br/><br/> RESOLVED by specifying external security (ACP or (D)TLS).  <br/><br/> </li>
  <li>The following open issues apply only if the current security model is retained: <ul><li>2.1. For replay protection, GDNP currently requires every participant to have an NTP-synchronized clock. Is this OK for low-end devices, and how does it work during device bootstrapping? We could take the Timestamp out of signature option, to become an independent and OPTIONAL (or RECOMMENDED) option.</li><li>2.2. The Signature Option states that this option could be any place in a message. Wouldn't it be better to specify a position (such as the end)? That would be much simpler to implement. </li></ul><p>RESOLVED by changing security model.</p></li>
  <li>3. DoS Attack Protection needs work.  <br/><br/> RESOLVED by adding text.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>4. Should we consider preferring a text-based approach to discovery (after the initial discovery needed for bootstrapping)? This could be a complementary mechanism for multicast based discovery, especially for a very large autonomic network. Centralized registration could be automatically deployed incrementally. At the very first stage, the repository could be empty; then it could be filled in by the objectives discovered by different devices (for example using Dynamic DNS Update). The more records are stored in the repository, the less the multicast-based discovery is needed. However, if we adopt such a mechanism, there would be challenges: stateful solution, and security.  <br/><br/> RESOLVED for now by adding optional use of DNS-SD by ASAs.<br/><br/> </li>
  <li>5. Need to expand description of the minimum requirements for the specification of an individual discovery, synchronization or negotiation objective. </li>
  <li>6. Use case and protocol walkthrough. A description of how a node starts up, performs discovery, and conducts negotiation and synchronisation for a sample use case would help readers to understand the applicability of this specification.  Maybe it should be an artificial use case or maybe a simple real one, based on a conceptual API. However, the authors have not yet decided whether to have a separate document or have it in the protocol document. </li>
  <li>7. Cross-check against other ANIMA WG documents for consistency and gaps.</li>
  <li>8. Consideration of ADNCP proposal.  <br/><br/> RESOLVED by adding optional use of DNCP for flooding-type synchronization.  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>9. Clarify how a GDNP instance knows whether it is running inside the ACP. (Sheng) <br/><br/> RESOLVED by improved text.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>10. Clarify how a non-ACP GDNP instance initiates (D)TLS. (Sheng) <br/><br/> RESOLVED by improved text and declaring DTLS out of scope for this draft.  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>11. Clarify how UDP/TCP choice is made. (Sheng) [Like DNS? - Brian] <br/><br/> RESOLVED by improved text.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>12. Justify that IP address within ACP or (D)TLS environment is sufficient to prove AN identity; or explain how Device Identity Option is used. (Sheng) <br/><br/> RESOLVED for now: we assume that all ASAs in a device are trusted as soon as the device is trusted, so they share credentials. In that case the Device Identity Option is useless. This needs to be reviewed later.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>13. Emphasise that negotiation/synchronization are independent from discovery, although the rapid discovery mode includes the first step of a negotiation/synchronization.  (Sheng) <br/><br/> RESOLVED by improved text. <br/><br/></li>
  <li>14. Do we need an unsolicited flooding mechanism for discovery (for discovery results that everyone needs), to reduce scaling impact of flooding discovery messages? (Toerless)</li>
  <li>15. Do we need flag bits in Objective Options to distinguish distinguish Synchronization and Negotiation "Request" or rapid mode "Discovery" messages? (Bing) <br/><br/> RESOLVED: yes, work on the API showed that these flags are essential. </li>
  <li>16. (Related to issue 14). Should we revive the "unsolicited Response" for flooding synchronisation data? This has to be done carefully due to the well-known issues with flooding, but it could be useful, e.g. for intent distribution, where DNCP doesn't seem applicable.</li>
  <li>17. Ensure that the discovery mechanism is completely proof against loops and protected against duplicate responses.</li>
  <li>18. Discuss the handling of multiple valid discovery responses.</li>
  <li>19. Should we use a text-oriented format such as JSON/CBOR instead of native binary TLV format? </li>
  <li>20. Is the Divert option needed? If a discovery response provides a valid IP address or FQDN, the recipient doesn't gain any extra knowledge from the Divert.</li>
  <li>21. Rename the protocol as GRASP (GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol)?</li>

<h1 id="rfc.section.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#security" id="security">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">It is obvious that a successful attack on negotiation-enabled nodes would be extremely harmful, as such nodes might end up with a completely undesirable configuration that would also adversely affect their peers.  GDNP nodes and messages therefore require full protection. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">- Authentication</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A cryptographically authenticated identity for each device is needed in an autonomic network. It is not safe to assume that a large network is physically secured against interference or that all personnel are trustworthy. Each autonomic device MUST be capable of proving its identity and authenticating its messages. GDNP relies on a separate certificate-based security mechanism to support authentication, data integrity protection, and anti-replay protection.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">Since GDNP is intended to be deployed in a single administrative domain operating its own trust anchor and CA, there is no need for a trusted public third party. In a network requiring "air gap" security, such a dependency would be unacceptable. </dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">- Privacy and confidentiality</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">Generally speaking, no personal information is expected to be involved in the signaling protocol, so there should be no direct impact on personal privacy. Nevertheless, traffic flow paths, VPNs, etc. could be negotiated, which could be of interest for traffic analysis. Also, operators generally want to conceal details of their network topology and traffic density from outsiders. Therefore, since insider attacks cannot be excluded in a large network, the security mechanism for the protocol MUST provide message confidentiality.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">- DoS Attack Protection</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">GDNP discovery partly relies on insecure link-local multicast. Since routers participating in GDNP sometimes relay discovery messages from one link to another, this could be a vector for denial of service attacks. Relevant mitigations are specified in <a href="#discmech">Section 3.3.3</a>. Additionally, it is of great importance that firewalls prevent any GDNP messages from entering the domain from an untrusted source. </dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">- Security during bootstrap and discovery</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A node cannot authenticate GDNP traffic from other nodes until it has identified the trust anchor and can validate certificates for other nodes. Also, until it has succesfully enrolled <a href="#I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra">[I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]</a> it cannot assume that other nodes are able to authenticate its own traffic.

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A">Appendix A.</a> <a href="#current" id="current">Capability Analysis of Current Protocols</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This appendix discusses various existing protocols with properties related to the above negotiation and synchronisation requirements. The purpose is to evaluate whether any existing protocol, or a simple combination of existing protocols, can meet those requirements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">Numerous protocols include some form of discovery, but these all appear to be very specific in their applicability. Service Location Protocol (SLP) <a href="#RFC2608">[RFC2608]</a> provides service discovery for managed networks, but requires configuration of its own servers. DNS-SD <a href="#RFC6763">[RFC6763]</a> combined with mDNS <a href="#RFC6762">[RFC6762]</a> provides service discovery for small networks with a single link layer. <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-requirements">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-requirements]</a> aims to extend this to larger autonomous networks. However, both SLP and DNS-SD appear to target primarily application layer services, not the layer 2 and 3 objectives relevant to basic network configuration. Both SLP and DNS-SD are text-based protocols. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.3">Routing protocols are mainly one-way information announcements. The receiver makes independent decisions based on the received information and there is no direct feedback information to the announcing peer. This remains true even though the protocol is used in both directions between peer routers; there is state synchronization, but no negotiation, and each peer runs its route calculations independently.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.4">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <a href="#RFC3416">[RFC3416]</a> uses a command/response model not well suited for peer negotiation. Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) <a href="#RFC6241">[RFC6241]</a> uses an RPC model that does allow positive or negative responses from the target system, but this is still not adequate for negotiation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.5">There are various existing protocols that have elementary negotiation abilities, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) <a href="#RFC3315">[RFC3315]</a>, Neighbor Discovery (ND) <a href="#RFC4861">[RFC4861]</a>, Port Control Protocol (PCP) <a href="#RFC6887">[RFC6887]</a>, Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) <a href="#RFC2865">[RFC2865]</a>, Diameter <a href="#RFC6733">[RFC6733]</a>, etc. Most of them are configuration or management protocols. However, they either provide only a simple request/response model in a master/slave context or very limited negotiation abilities.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.6">There are some signaling protocols with an element of negotiation.  For example Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) <a href="#RFC2205">[RFC2205]</a> was designed for negotiating quality of service parameters along the path of a unicast or multicast flow. RSVP is a very specialised protocol aimed at end-to-end flows. However, it has some flexibility, having been extended for MPLS label distribution <a href="#RFC3209">[RFC3209]</a>.  A more generic design is General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) <a href="#RFC5971">[RFC5971]</a>, but it is complex, tries to solve many problems, and is also aimed at per-flow signaling across many hops rather than at device-to-device signaling.  However, we cannot completely exclude extended RSVP or GIST as a synchronization and negotiation protocol. They do not appear to be directly useable for peer discovery.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.7">We now consider two protocols that are works in progress at the time of this writing. Firstly, RESTCONF <a href="#I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf">[I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf]</a> is a protocol intended to convey NETCONF information expressed in the YANG language via HTTP, including the ability to transit HTML intermediaries. While this is a powerful approach in the context of centralised configuration of a complex network, it is not well adapted to efficient interactive negotiation between peer devices, especially simple ones that are unlikely to include YANG processing already.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.8">Secondly, we consider Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP) <a href="#I-D.ietf-homenet-dncp">[I-D.ietf-homenet-dncp]</a>. This is defined as a generic form of state synchronization protocol, with a proposed usage profile being the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) <a href="#I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp">[I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp]</a> for configuring Homenet routers. A specific application of DNCP for autonomic networking was proposed in <a href="#I-D.stenberg-anima-adncp">[I-D.stenberg-anima-adncp]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.9">Specific features of DNCP include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Every participating node has a unique node identifier.</li>
  <li>DNCP messages are encoded as a sequence of TLV objects, sent over unicast UDP or TCP, with or without (D)TLS security.</li>
  <li>Multicast is used only for discovery of DNCP neighbors when lower security is acceptable.</li>
  <li>Synchronization of state is maintained by a flooding process using the Trickle algorithm.  There is no bilateral synchronization or negotiation capability.</li>
  <li>The HNCP profile of DNCP is designed to operate between directly connected neighbors on a shared link using UDP and link-local IPv6 addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p> Clearly DNCP does not meet the needs of a general negotiation protocol, especially in its HNCP profile due to the limitation to link-local messages and its strict dependency on IPv6. However, at the minimum it is a very interesting test case for this style of interaction between devices without needing a central authority, and it is a proven method of network-wide state synchronization by flooding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.10">A proposal was made some years ago for an IP based Generic Control Protocol (IGCP) <a href="#I-D.chaparadza-intarea-igcp">[I-D.chaparadza-intarea-igcp]</a>. This was aimed at information exchange and negotiation but not directly at peer discovery. However, it has many points in common with the present work.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.11">None of the above solutions appears to completely meet the needs of generic discovery, state synchronization and negotiation in a single solution.  Neither is there an obvious combination of protocols that does so.  Therefore, this document proposes the design of a protocol that does meet those needs. However, this proposal needs to be compared with alternatives such as extension and adaptation of GIST or DNCP, or combination with IGCP.</p>
